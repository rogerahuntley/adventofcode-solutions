# adventofcode-solutions

these are my JS solutions to the annual [advent of code challenge](https://adventofcode.com/).

you can run these in the shell with node, or through the front end I built at [adventofcode.neocities.org](https://adventofcode.neocities.org)

### running

you can clone just this repo and check the answers with node, use this helper function:

```
npm run test <year>/<day>/<solution>
npm run test 2022/10/solution2.js
```
